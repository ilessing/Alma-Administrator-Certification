ExLibris requires libraries using their [Alma software](http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/AlmaOverview) to have staff trained to administer the Alma system.

The training mainly consists of learning to understand and configure the Alma software.  This training is mostly accomplished by watching recorded training sessions while listening to careful and detailed narration by and expert user administrator.

Because the information presented in the videos is rather dry, dense and esoteric the best way to really learn the material is to take careful notes while watching... pausing the video very often to write notes.  

The notes gathered here are offered in hopes they will assist others as they learn Alma Administration and study to become certified Alma admins.

Good luck on your exam!
